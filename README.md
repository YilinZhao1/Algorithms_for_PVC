# Algorithms_for_PVC

code in pvc.py and 'pulp' package needed to be install -- pip install pulp

IMPORTANT: Before running the code, change the path file at the test part at the end. Change the test size if you want.

result_*.zip files contain both of the solution and the time of the algorithms for each test and time-size plots.

solution_*.zip files contain the solution of algorithms
